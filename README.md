- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadHattor
- 👀 I’m interested in all things crypto and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and am looking to Python next. I'm also starting essentially from scratch, so treat me like a beginner for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now. Trust me when I tell you that you don't want my help yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: email can be sent to MadHattor@proton.me
